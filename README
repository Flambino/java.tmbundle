Hey!  One I actually wrote! :-)

Features the following:
• bare-bones command for running ant.
  I'm not too happy with the way TM handles the external command or the new
  window, so I mostly stick with Terminal.app for this one.

• snippet for creating getters and setters
  I'm pretty happy with this one. The order you do the placeholders is a
  little weird, but it does work...

• syntaxes for properties files and the Java language

• "Java Source" template
